## Data and Notebook Files

This repository includes important model and analysis files which you can download and use:

- **Model Files (`.h5`):**  
  These files contain the pre-trained models saved in HDF5 format. You can load these models directly into your Python environment using libraries like TensorFlow or Keras.

- **Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`):**  
  The notebook contains code to train, evaluate, and visualize the models and datasets. It is a helpful guide to understand how the `.h5` files were created and used.
